Proposal: Build the “DataOps Engine”
A secure, multilingual, human-in-the-loop platform to win the clients now defecting from Scale.ai
1. Why now?
Scale.ai’s moat is breaking. Google—the company’s largest account—plans to terminate its $200 M annual contract after Meta bought a 49% stake in Scale. Microsoft, xAI and OpenAI are also reassessing their dependence on the firm.

Clients need an immediate, enterprise-grade alternative that protects proprietary data, offers elastic capacity and lowers cost without sacrificing quality.
Tech Mahindra already operates Populii, a crowdsourcing platform for AI and data-labelling tasks, and has deep BPS/infosec expertise.
Freelancer brings the world’s largest on-demand talent marketplace (80M+ professionals in 247 countries). 
Together we can stand-up a best-in-class replacement—fast.
2. Joint Vision: The DataOps Engine
True neutral, vendor-agnostic platform trusted by hyperscalers
Independent governance; no single cloud, VC or competitor can gain control
Strategic partnership structure
Tech Mahindra: Fortune G2000 relationships, enterprise sales, managed services
e.g. layer of data scientists to interface with client product managers providing model refinement etc.
Freelancer: Technology, operations & world’s largest cloud workforce with 80m across 247 countries, 24 × 7 operations
Platform
Built on the existing Freelancer Enterprise stack, the DataOps Engine would immediately inherit the platform’s project liquidity (68% of jobs attract bids within 60 seconds), a real-time web single page architecture platform, multi-lingual, multi-currency, global payout rails that include KYC/AML and country-specific tax withholding, a mature ratings/feedback system that feeds worker quality scores, established capability to marshall, qualify and curate 20,000+ workers per day for a specific engagement.
Talent cloud excellence & scale
Multilingual talent pools (phase 1)
Automatic routing to approved talent pools (phase 1)
Instant natural language requirements <> demographic / skill / compliance filtering & marshalling (with protected-attribute masking) (phase 1*** FLN already building)
Training:
Structured micro-learning libraries and LMS for task-specific training (phase 1)
Pre-qualification quizzes, on-task probation (phase 1)
Modular certifications (incl. arbitrary oral/viva AI exams) (phase 1)
AI-driven interviewer for real-time skill verification and profile enrichment (phase 1)
Notifications / Blasts 2.0
Sub-second push notifications to web, mobile, CLI & chat apps
Combined with AI interviewer (phase 1)
Qualifies
Routing to certifications if required
User profile annotation from interview results
Credentialing
Ephemeral credential pools with just-in-time provisioning and instant revocation (phase 1)
Pools for any work platform
Timetracker 2.0: 
Fine-grained audit logs, screen capture & keystroke escrow (opt-in) (phase 2)
AI suggestions & quality assurance
Supported task modalities
On-platform: large-file ingestion (receipts, logs, sensor dumps, audio, etc.) (phase 2)
Smaller vendors won’t have a task execution platform
Plugin architecture for task execution: 
Data labelling on platform for vision, language, speech; eval & red-teaming workflows (phase 2)
Dataloop- execution platform
TechMahindra Generative AI Studio? RegenAI?
Work execution as “apps” so anybody can work, any credentials	
One plugin will be PhotoAnywhere 2.0: 
SurveyAnywhere: capture photo, video, audio, geotag, annotate and fill in form data in one flow at any GPS coordinate in the world (phase 2)
Payments, tax & compliance
Global multi-currency payouts with local tax withholding and e-invoices (phase 1)
KYC/AML checks and sanctions screening (done)
Continuous QA & Talent Governance
Rolling accuracy dashboards- enforced minimum scores; automatic queue gating when thresholds aren’t met (phase 1)
Dynamic talent curation- instant promotion, demotion or lock-out based on live SLA and quality metrics from vendor (phase 1)
Real-time behaviour analytics- anomaly scoring and policy enforcement to prevent low-quality submissions (phase 2)
Auto-triggered remediation- micro-lessons, retraining quizzes and mandatory recertification before pool re-entry (phase 2)
Scheduled blind re-audits- periodic sampling and benchmark refresh to detect drift and sustain precision (phase 2)
Quality & analytics
Real-time dashboards on throughput, accuracy and cost (phase 1)
Adaptive sampling, consensus, gold-standard or majority-vote verification (phase 2)
Model-in-the-loop auto-suggestions, auto-QA and active-learning prioritisation in which the model itself flags the most informative or most uncertain data points for human review (phase 2)
Worker classification & legal compliance
Automatic contractor vs. employee determination per jurisdiction (phase 2)
IP-transfer & NDA management baked into task acceptance flow (done)
Commercial & support model
Transparent usage-based pricing plus tiered SLAs (see below)
24 × 7 multilingual support; dedicated Technical Account Manager (TechMahindra & Freelancer support to TM) 
≤ 48 h onboarding & job-to-execution 
3. Differentiation vs. Scale.ai
Open-platform economics. No vendor lock-in; bring your own model, storage and labeling UI (phase 2)


Elastic talent supply. 80m workers vs. Scale’s ~240k contractor pool (remotask)- plus Tech M BPS agents for managed tiers.


Client-first data governance. No single competitor (e.g., Meta) will ever own a controlling stake.
4. Commercial model
Subscription tiers (SaaS access (in time)?, SLA, data residency) + usage fees (work).


Managed service upsell: Tech M BPS teams can offer QC, model evaluation and prompt-engineering bundles.
5. What we have learned
We know the flows and types of work that are required from clients
Clients often demand <48h turnaround time from completely new requirements to work product delivery
Notification of work availability instant - no TM/FLN “account managers in the loop” - client request of work to on-device notification of pre-qualified approved talent pools of freelancers needs to be in seconds not hours or days
Cheat-proof knowledge certification is required for talent pool formation
Credential provisioning needs to be instant not days
Quality assurance of work output needs to be done in real-time, not three weeks later on payment, with immediate rectification
Payments to freelancers need to timely and reliable to minimize churn
5. Next steps
Two-hour executive-alignment workshop (Thu 19th June or Mon 23rd June)


Lock high-level scope, success metrics and decision-makers


Architecture design sprint (Weeks 2 - 3)


Produce phased delivery roadmap and resource plan


Build


Create and execute detailed Statement of Work
Continuous, phased delivery to minimise time to market
Co-branded UI design, leveraging Freelancer’s mature design system
Built on Freelancer’s battle-tested technology stack:
Resilient infrastructure to handle internet-scale traffic
Multi-modal communications (text, phone, video)
Agentic AI framework
Omni-channel notifications (push, browser, email, SMS)
Performant single-page architecture
Multi-lingual / multi-currency from the ground up
Google PM launch kit

Coordinated email push to all Google product managers via alliance team


Hyperscaler roadshow


On-site / virtual demos for Microsoft, AWS, Meta, xAI, Anthropic, etc.


Capture PoC commitments and schedule follow-up workshops
6. Value Proposition
Converts Populii from a pure crowdsourcing experiment into a multi-billion-dollar DataOps line of business.


Creates the neutral and secure refuge for hyperscalers wary of Meta-aligned Scale.ai.


Leverages a pre-existing freelancer super-highway instead of building one from scratch, accelerating time-to-revenue.
Together, we can seize the market window created by Scale.ai’s client exodus and become the default human-in-the-loop engine for the next decade of enterprise AI.
